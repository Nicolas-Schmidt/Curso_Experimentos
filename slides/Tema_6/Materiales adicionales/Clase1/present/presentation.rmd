# History and Logic

---

## Experiments: History I

Oxford English Dictionary defines “experiment” as:

- A scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact

- A course of action tentatively adopted without being sure of the outcome

---

## Experiments: History II

-“Experiments” have a very long history

- Major advances in design and analysis of
experiments based on agricultural and later
biostatistical research in the 19th century
(Fisher, Neyman, Pearson, etc.)

- Multiple origins in the social sciences
	+ First randomized experiment by Peirce and Jastrow (1884)
	+ Gosnell (1924)
	+ LaLonde (1986)
	+ Gerber and Green (2000)



## Experiments: History III

- Rise of surveys in the behavioral revolution
	+ Survey research not heavily experimental because interviewing was mostly paper-based
	+ Split ballots (e.g., Schuman & Presser; Bishop)

- 1983: Merrill Shanks and the Berkeley Survey Research Center develop CATI

- Mid-1980s: Paul Sniderman & Tom Piazza performed the first modern survey experiment^[Sniderman, Paul M., and Thomas Piazza. 1993. The Scar of Race. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.]
	- Then: the “first multi-investigator”
	- Later: Arthur Lupia and Diana Mutz created TESS




## TESS
- Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences

- Multi-disciplinary initiative that provides infrastructure for survey experiments on nationally representative samples of the United States population

- Great resource for survey experimental materials, designs, and data

- Funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation

- Anyone anywhere in the world can apply

- See also: LISS, Bergen’s Citizen Panel, Gothenburg’s
Citizen Panel

## Definitions I

- A randomized experiment is:

*The observation of units after, and possibly before, a randomly assigned intervention in a controlled setting, which tests one or more precise causal expectations*


- If we manipulate the thing we want to know
the effect of ($X$), and control (i.e., hold
constant) everything we do not want to know
the effect of ($\mathbf{Z}$), the only thing that can affect
the outcome ($Y$) is $X$.



## Definitions II

- A survey experiment is just an experiment that occurs in
a survey context
	+ As opposed to in the field or in a laboratory

- Can be in any mode (face-to-face, CATI, IVR, CASI,
etc.)

- May or may not involve a representative population
Mutz (2011): “population-based survey experiments”




## Definitions II

**Unit**: A physical object at a particular point in time


## Definitions II

**Treatment**: An intervention, whose effect(s) we wish to assess relative to some other
(non-)intervention


**Synonyms**: manipulation, intervention, factor,
condition, cell



## Definitions II

**Outcome**: The variable we are trying to explain



## Definitions II

**Potential outcomes**: The outcome value for each unit that we would observe if that unit received
each treatment 


Multiple potential outcomes for each unit, but we
only observe one of them



## Definitions II

**Causal effect**: The comparisons between the
unit-level potential outcomes under each
intervention

*This is what we want to know!*


## Definitions II

**Average causal effect**: Difference in mean
outcomes between treatment groups

*This is almost what we want to know!*



## Example
**Unit**: Americans in 1940

**Outcome**: Support for military intervention

**Treatment**: Mentioning Hitler versus not

**Potential outcomes** :

1. Support in “Hitler” condition
2. Support in control condition

**Causal effect**: Difference in support between the
two question wordings for each respondent

- Individual treatment effect not observable!
- Average effect (ATE) is the mean-difference


## Questions?


## Why are experiments useful?


Causal inference!



## Addressing Confounding

In observational research... 

1. Correlate a “putative” cause ($X$) and an outcome ($Y$), where X temporally precedes $Y$  \pause
1. Identify all possible confounds ($\mathbf{Z}$)  \pause
1. ''Condition'' on all confounds \pause
	+ Calculate correlation between $X$ and $Y$ at each combination of levels of $\mathbf{Z}$ \pause

1. Basically: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_{2-k}\mathbf{Z} + \epsilon$

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{confound2}
\end{center}



## Experiments are different

1. Causal inferences from design not analysis
2. Solves both temporal ordering and confounding
	+ Treatment ($X$) applied by researcher before outcome ($Y$)
	+ Randomization eliminates confounding ($\mathbf{Z}$)
	+ We don’t need to “control” for anything

3. Basically: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X  + \epsilon$


4. Thus experiments are a “gold standard”



## Mill’s Method of Difference

If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation
occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every
circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in
the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances
differ, is the effect, or cause, or an necessary part of the cause,
of the phenomenon.

## Questions?


## Neyman-Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework

If we are interested in some outcome $Y$, then for
every unit $i$, there are numerous “potential
outcomes” $Y$* only one of which is visible in a given
reality. Comparisons of (partially unobservable)
potential outcomes indicate causality.



## Neyman-Rubin Potential Outcomes Framework

Concisely, we typically discuss two potential
outcomes:

- $Y_{0i}$ , the potential outcome realized if $X_i = 0$

	+ (because $D_i = 0$, assigned to control)


- $Y_{1i}$ , the potential outcome realized if $X_i = 1$

	+ (because $D_i = 1$, assigned to treatment)


## Experimental Inference I

Each unit has multiple *potential* outcomes, but we only
observe one of them, randomly


## Experimental Inference I

Each unit has multiple *potential* outcomes, but we only
observe one of them, randomly

In this sense, we are sampling potential outcomes from
each unit’s population of potential outcomes


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{po}
\end{center}


## Experimental Inference II

- We cannot see individual-level causal effects
- We can see average causal effects

	+ Ex.: Average difference in military support among those thinking of Hitler versus not
- We want to know: $TE_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$


## Experimental Inference III

- We want to know: $TE_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$ for every $i$ in the population

- We can average:  $E[TE_{i}] = E[Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}] = E[Y_{1i}] - E[Y_{0i}]$

- But we still only see one potential outcome for each unit: $ATE_{naive} = E[Y_{1}|X = 1] - E[Y_{0}|X = 0]$

 - *Is this what we want to know?*


## Experimental Inference IV

- What we want and what we have:
$$ATE =E[Y_{1}] - E[Y_{0}]$$
$$ATE_{naive} = E[Y_{1}|X = 1] - E[Y_{0}|X = 0]$$


Are the following statements true?
$$E[Y_{1}] = E[Y_{1}|X = 1]$$
$$E[Y_{0}] = E[Y_{0}|X = 0]$$

- Not in general 


## Experimental Inference V

- Only true when both of the following hold:

$$E[Y_{1}] = E[Y_{1}|X = 1] = E[Y_{1}|X = 0]$$
$$E[Y_{0}] = E[Y_{0}|X = 1] = E[Y_{0}|X = 0]$$

- In that case, potential outcomes are independent of
treatment assignment

- If true (e.g., due to randomization of X), then:


$$ATE_{naive} = E[Y_{1}|X = 1] - E[Y_{0}|X = 0]$$
$$ = E[Y_{1}] - E[Y_{0}]$$
$$ = ATE$$


## Experimental Inference VI

- This holds in experiments because of a physical process of randomization

- Units differ only in side of coin that was up
	+ $X_i = 1$ only because $D_i =1$

- Implications: 
	+ Covariate balance
	+ Potential outcomes balanced and independent of treatment assignment
	+ No confounding (selection bias)

## Questions?



## Experimental Analysis I

- The statistic of interest in an experiment is the *sample average treatment effect* (SATE)
- If our sample is representative, then this provides an estimate of the *population average treatment* (PATE)
	+ Design-based random sampling 
	+ Model-based re-weighting

- This boils down to being a mean-difference between two groups:


$$SATE = \frac{1}{n_1}\sum Y_{1i} - \frac{1}{n_0}\sum Y_{0i}$$




## Tidy Experimental Data

Sometimes it looks like this instead, which is bad:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{badexpdata}
\end{center}


## Tidy Experimental Data

An experimental data structure looks like:

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.1in]{expdata}
\end{center}





## Computation of Effects I

- In practice we often estimate SATE using t-tests, ANOVA, or OLS regression

- These are all basically equivalent

- Reasons to choose one procedure over another:
	+ Disciplinary norms
	+ Ease of interpretation
	+ Flexibility for >2 treatment conditions



## Computation of Effects II

R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.test(outcome ~ treatment, data = data)
lm(outcome ~ factor(treatment), data = data)
```


## Questions?


## Experimental Analysis II

- We don’t just care about the size of the SATE. We also want to know whether it is significantly different from zero (i.e., different from no effect/difference)

- Thus we need to estimate the variance of the SATE 

- The variance is influenced by:
	+ Total sample size
	+ Element variance of the outcome, $Y$ 
	+ Relative size of each treatment group 
	+ (Some other factors)



## Experimental Analysis III

Variance of the SATE

- $\widehat{Var}(SATE) = \frac{\widehat{Var}(\bar{Y}_0)}{n_0} + \frac{\widehat{Var}(\bar{Y}_1)}{n_1}$

	+ Where $\widehat{Var}(Y_{0i})$ is control group variance 
	+ And $\widehat{Var}(Y_{1i})$ is treatment group variance


And the standard error of the variance is

- $\widehat{SE}_{SATE} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{Var}(\bar{Y}_0)}{n_0} + \frac{\widehat{Var}(\bar{Y}_1)}{n_1}}$


##  Intuition about Variance

- Bigger sample --> smaller SEs 
- Smaller variance --> smaller SEs

- Efficient use of sample size:
	+ When treatment group variances equal, equal sample sizes are most efficient
	+ When variances differ, sample units are better allocated to the group with higher variance in $Y$



## Statistical Power
Power analysis is used to determine sample size before conducting an experiment

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{power}
\end{center}


True positive rate ($1-k$) is power

False positive rate is the significance threshold ($\alpha$)


## Power calculation

- $\mu$, Treatment group mean outcomes 
- N, Sample size
- $\sigma$, Outcome variance
- $\alpha$ Statistical significance threshold
- $\Phi$  CDF of a sampling distribution.

$$
\beta = \Phi \left(\frac{|\mu_t-\mu_c|\sqrt{N}}{2\sigma}-\Phi^{-1} \left(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) \right)
$$

- $\beta$ is Power, with distribution [0,1]. 



## Intuition about Power

Minimum detectable effect is the smallest effect we could detect given sample size, “true” ATE, variance of outcome measure, power ($1 - k$), and $\alpha$.

In essence: some non-zero effect sizes are not detectable by a study of a given sample size.

In underpowered study, we will be unlikely to detect true small effects. And most effects are small!^[Gelman, A. and Weakliem, D. 2009. “Of Beauty, Sex and Power.” American Scientist 97(4): 310–16]

# Factorial Designs

## Factorial Designs

-  The two-condition experiment is a stylized ideal

- An experiment can have any number of conditions
	+ Up to the limits of sample size
	+ More than 8–10 conditions is typically unwieldy

- Three “flavors”:
	+ Multiple conditions in a single factor
	+ Multiple fully crossed factors
	+ Partially crossed (“fractional factorial”) designs

- Regression methods provide a generalizable tool for causal inference in such designs

---------------------   -------------  -------------



## Two ways to parameterize this


Dummy variable regression (i.e., treatment–control CATEs):

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{0,1} + \beta_{2}X_{1,0} + \beta_{3}X_{1,1} + \epsilon$$

Interaction effects (i.e., treatment–treatment CATEs):

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X1_{1} + \beta_{2}X2_{1} + \beta_{3}(X1_{1}\times X2_{1}) + \epsilon$$



## Sample size for factorial designs

|        3 |                     4  |               12 | 2400  | 
|        4 |                     4  |               14 | 3200  | 


The examples assume power to detect a relatively small effect, but no consideration of multiple comparisons.


## Considerations

- Factorial designs can quickly become unwieldy and expensive

- Need to consider what CATEs are of theoretical interest
	+ Treatment-control, pairwise 
	+ Treatment-treatment, pairwise
	+ Marginal effects, averaging across other factors
	+ Comparison of merged conditions
